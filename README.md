For this assignment, the task was to produce a website designed to act as a collection of images. In order to achieve this, a number of steps were taken to ensure that the quality of the website was to a good standard. The particular elements that have been developed into the website include Google Fonts, a functioning navigation bar and a number of image styling elements (as these were missing from the initial assignment). 
The initial design for the website was to produce a number of stylish yet simple webpages that contain a background image, a fluid navigation bar, descriptions, images and links to social media. The navigation bar works by linking the user to the other relevant html pages. The bar is black with white text, features across the entire width of the screen/webpage and uses the Raleway google font. Each page features a background image, where text and other elements have been placed over. Images which allow elements to stand out have been selected and optimised to ensure that text and other elements are not too difficult to identify. 
Each individual image has been styled so that they zoom in when hovered over and resize when this is not true. The main profile image of myself is circular at the top centre of every webpage. For the collection of images, these have been positioned in a grid on the collection webpage, along with brief descriptions underneath and surrounding borders.
The contact page features a contact form which contains a name, email and message field. This page also contains a number of social media links which are functioning and take the user to the corresponding sites. These links are not profile specific but run to the home page of the social media site.

The process of conducting this assignment involved improving on the aspects of the first website produced earlier in the year, evaluating the results of the marking rubric and targeting specific areas for improvement. A key area that was poor in the previous assignment was the responsiveness of the overall webpages. When the pages were resized, the individual elements did not respond to the size changes. This has been improved greatly in this assignment, as the contents of the webpage are now responsive to size changes.
There are some extra features that could have been included, such as a greater breadth of description within the body of the webpages and some border and padding elements to improve the overall layout.
In total, around 20-30 hours has been spent on this assignment, much of this involved tweaking and modifying small errors and corrections in both the html pages and CSS through atom. This ‘tweaking’ took place to ensure that both the styling areas and overall look of the webpage were to a satisfactory standard.
In conclusion, the overall look and feel of the webpage conform to many of the requirements of the brief, and the webpages in my own personal view, are an improvement on those previously submitted. There are some areas where the website could be improved, particularly with spacing and borders. The website is available via the github link below:
